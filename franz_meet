what does a 2-fold increase in Gflop/s buy you in 

how can spiral help Wavelet transformation? 

Can wavelet transformations or families of wavelet transforms 
be generalized?

BigDFT: uses wavelet transforms

BigDFT is abinitio and scales linearly with system size Ne, 
but only after 1e3 atoms is reached.  

Reaches a peak because of the memory of FPGA?
